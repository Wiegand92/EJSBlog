# EJSBlog

## About

This is a blog site built using EJS, express, and lodash. I got to tool around with learning EJS and Bootstrap for this project. As well as learning how to render with template engines in Express

## Roadmap

I believe later in the course I will be creating a DB with mongoDB. Other than that I might host this one.
